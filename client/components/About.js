        My name is Celia Macrae. I am a full-stack web developer based in New
        York, NY. I recently graduated from Duke University (2019) with a
        Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and a minor in Sociology,
        particularly focused on Educational Sociology. After graduating, I
        completed the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy to sharpen my
        technical skills (NERD Stack) and gain experience working on agile
        teams. I am currently working as a Software Engineering Teaching Fellow
        at Fullstack Academy and seeking fulltime employment as a Software
        Engineer.
